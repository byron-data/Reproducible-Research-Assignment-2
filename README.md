## US Storms - Associated Human and Economic Costs
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The NOAA data will be checked for consistency and cleaned where appropriate. The cleaned data will then be processed to produce summary statistics of the human fatalities, human injuries, property damage and crop damage caused by storms. The summary statistics will be presented in graphical form to make them easier to understand.
